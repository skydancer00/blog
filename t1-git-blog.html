      Describe version control: Version control, or revision control, source control is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information. Version control lets me track my files over time. Changes are identified by a number or letter.

        Explain how git tracks changes: 
        git log -p filename: to let git generate the patches

        git add .: add the changes in the current directory

        git commit: make a node

        git push: send it out to the online folder
    </p>

        Evaluate the benefits of using GitHub to store code: At this stage, all I could think of is that it can be shared with the others. However, according to Wikipedia, there were a lot more benefits as such - 
        GitHub states that any "knowlewdge worker" (defined as almost any professional who makes use of a computer) can benefit.
