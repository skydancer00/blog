      When the phase 0 of the DevAcademy Boot Camp started on 15 December, I was fully booked until 23rd of February from Christmas day. I didn’t aware of the phase 0 was about to start from 15 December, which required more than 20 hours each week. After many hours of painful consideration, I have cancelled all the trips and fortunately people affected by this change understand where I was and wished me luck. Two weeks extension really helped me as I’ve had a new laptop and gone through everything again with it and now I’m about to finish all the tasks of the week one.

      Now, my calendar is empty except one or two less than half day meetings.

      Coding or IT is new to me. Also, knowing that the course is fairly new and fast moving, there are many places I need to contribute to make the program complete. Some may need further detailed explanation to students like me even though they may be commonly known to the IT people.

      Which should be ideal mindset or attitude towards the DevA Boot Camp course, consumer/restaurant mindset, or kitchen mindset? I’m definitely get in the course with a kitchen mindset. We are helping each other, to create a Win/Win outcome.
